## What is Ulysses?

Ulysses, named after the latin variant of the Greek epic hero Odysseus, is a Unity-built interface for Chrysanthemum. Ulysses reads the specifications for how many cities to generate, generates the cities, and then writes the data back to Chrysanthemum. Chrysanthemum then uses its neural network to generate a path through all the cities, writes that path back to Ulysses, which then visualizes the data. 

## How to use Ulysses

Ulysses is a Unity project built on version 2021.3.11f1 on Apple Silicon. To use Ulysses to inferface with Chrysanthemum, you will need to create a Unity project from the Unity Hub and then clone this repository into the project folder, replacing "Assets", "Packages", and "Project Settings" created by Unity by the folders of this repository. You will then need to provide Ulysses with the path to Chrysanthemum's directory in **COMING SOON** "Assets/path.json".

## What's next?

Ulysses is not finished. Ulysses needs improvement of visuals and capacity to visualize paths will be added next, as well as un-hardcoding the path to Chrysanthemum's directory.
